# EyesGuard
If you work a lot on a computer and want to keep your vision in order or to keep vision of your children and relatives, who are crazy of PC, this program will be very useful for you!

EyesGuard will remind you about necessity to do a break during long work on computer. This program places an icon into the system tray and does not disturb your work. It allows to set the time between breaks (work time), breaks duration (break time) and has some more functions: sound effects, turning your monitor off during the break.

EyesGuard is written in IDE Borland C++ Builder 6 (so it depends on VCL library).

Branch [lazarus](http://github.com/mburyakov/eyesguard/tree/lazarus) is for rewriting
the program in [Lazarus](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org) IDE using LCL library,
so the program will be able to run natively in other OS such as GNU/Linux.

You can get more information about the program on its [website](http://eyesguard.ru).
